             backpack like the backpack one attacker weared in a video showing one shooter, but the

             Yes but there's a definite sense that these things *shouldn't* be happening in these

             The attitude you have is one I equivocate to the one of police having quotas for
             driving tickets they get out. The fact that there is 7 billion people in the world, to
             me, doesn't make these horrific acts any less horrible. It's like kind of giving up and
             expecting murders to happen and treating them like the norm instead of actively trying
             to end the bloodshed.

             Sorry for the rant I just see the typical response all the time and I can't bring
             myself to agree with it.

                     there are 7 billion people in the world and this is the safest era to ever live

                 It's not necessarily giving up, but giving in. People do their part every day to
                 make the world a better place, clearly they haven't given up.

                 You said it yourself, there are 7 billion people in the world. 7 billion... that's
                 an awful lot of different values, different ideas, and different reasons for some
                 people to justify the bloodshed they create. Many of these terror groups (mostly
                 ISIS) are ideas- and you can't kill an idea.

                 I'm not trying to be a pessimist or condescending, but after a while the people who
                 want the world to be a better place and try to make it that way understand that we
                 will likely never be at peace in our lifetime- but never stop trying to make the

             According to http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls there were 277 deaths from
             mass shootings in the U.S. in 2014, and 332 from mass shootings in 2015. The average
             between 2014 and 2015 is 305 deaths per year caused by mass shooting.

             Edit: According to the above source, there were 12,589 gun violence deaths in 2014 and
             13,444 in 2015 in the U.S.

             There were 2,596,993 deaths in the U.S. in 2014
             (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm).

             Taking the mass shooting statistics from 2014, being 277 deaths, we get that
             332/2,596,993 = .0001% of all deaths in the United States were the result of a mass
             shooting in 2015.

             To put that into perspective, 30,208 died of falling off of stuff in 2013 in the United
             States (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/accidental-injury.htm). If these numbers are
             applied to 2014 they make up approximately .012% of the deaths in the united states in
             2014.

             Interestingly enough, the two highest killers in 2014 were
             Heart disease: 614,348
             Cancer: 591,699

             I used data from the U.S. because it was the easiest for me to find.

                     Kurt Vonnegut wrote something similar in *Slaughterhouse-Five*:

                     >It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who
                     flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes,
                     full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield
                     in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards,
                     sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They
                     did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew
                     up backwards to join the formation.

                     >The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The
                     bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which
                     shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted
                     the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored
                     neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which
                     were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen
                     and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the
                     bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again,
                     made everything and everybody as good as new.

                     >When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from
                     the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories
                     were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the
                     dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this
                     work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was
                     their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they
                     would never hurt anybody ever again.

             On cold and silent city streets
             In cars of crimson red,
             An engine whirs to life and beats
             A beat to stir the dead.

             They wake with curtains twitched aside,
             And try to hide, afraid -
             A gleaming rose and silver ride
             Arises through the shade.

             Their children shift in sleep and dream
             A dream of dread and dark -
             Of amber flame; the creaking scream
             Of blistered wood and spark.

             And so the wheels begin to turn.
             The shadows drift apart.
             The night ignites.
             Infernos burn.

             And sirens, somewhere, start.

                 When Timmy's cat climbed up a tree,
                 To catch a bite to eat,
                 He climbed as high as eyes could see,
                 T'was really quite the feat.

                 Then Timmy noticed 'Socks' was trapped,
                 And thus a plan was made,

                 Along they came and climbed the tree,

                 His precious Socks will soon be free,
                 So Timmy calmly sat.

                 He looked right up and on he gazed,
                 And watched them work with pride,
                 But then they set his cat ablaze,
                 And Timmy fucking died.

             stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next, he
             flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening

                         Soooo... I am a psychologist who plays Portal. So does my son. I set this
                         up as my ringtone for him. I also have ADHD. One morning I forgot to set my
                         ringer to silent. This was the same morning I was presenting assessment
                         results to a client. Guess who called right in the middle of reviewing the
                         report/results? I was equally mortified and amused. The client had a great
                         sense of humor so I let it finish ringing and we laughed about it, but
                         c'mon!? What are the chances of that happening? I still feel equal parts of
                         amusement and horror just thinking about it.

             Should be way more insidious than that. A Therapist should legitamise whatever you go
             see them for.

             "The voices are telling me to kill my parents and wear their skin"

             "They may have a point though, at least hear them out; see where they're going with it"

                 Mental health professional here. Fun (slightly off-topic) fact: one self-help
                 strategy for people with auditory hallucinations is to engage with the voices and
                 talk to them!

                 Of course, you wouldn't tell a client with homicidal voices to listen to the voices
                 and obey them, but patients' beliefs about the origins and qualities of their
                 voices have been shown to be highly influential on their experiences. Patients who
                 believe that their voices are powerful and malevolent have significantly more
                 distress than those who believe they're benign and/or benevolent. There has been at
                 least one study showing that therapy can help patients to test and change their
                 beliefs about their voices and that this allows them to cope better and even reduce
                 hallucinations.

                 EDIT: I just remembered a great [NPR
                 special](http://www.npr.org/2015/06/21/416272772/auditory-hallucinations-may-vary-
                 across-cultures) on cultural beliefs about auditory hallucinations and how they
                 affect clients' distress. Well worth a listen.
