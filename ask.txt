         I could understand not calling for backup if there wasn't a choice but they seem to just
         not call for backup and run in for no reason.

         Sometimes, one of them will yell, "What about backup?" and the other will yell, "There's
         isn't TIME!" and they'll both run in.  But a lot of times, if you thought about it, you'd
         think, "Wait - is that really true?"

             I feel like "there isn't time" is a pretty good answer to the OP.

             "There's no time to explain the plan I just concocted! We have to timeskip 4 hours to
             drive to our destination and we can't explain the plan off screen"

             "We can't help, there's no time to walk ten feet!"

             "There's no time to radio 'taking fire' or 'going in' or 'please help' or even an 'oh
             shit'"

         Recently started watching X Files on Netflix. For some reason I never really watched it
         when I was growing up. But, Christ, some of it is just so corny.

         Oh, there's a devolved caveman eating out of the garbage bins at night? I'll just wait here
         alone all night long and tell nobody where I'm at to see if I can catch a peek. Oh, we just

             My beef with highway chase scenes is that don't those other cars have rear view
             mirrors? You see cars racing around, shooting each other behind you and you still want
             to drive the same speed as them, in the middle lane?

             Even the following cars. "Oh a shootout, let's follow and drive as close as possible
             instead of hitting the brakes and let them go as far away from us as possible"

             Action movies piss me off sometimes.

                 The reason that I like the movie has nothing to do with the Gosling/McAdams
                 storyline, and everything to do with James Garner. To be THAT in love with your
                 wife, to be THAT devoted, that even when she's forgotten EVERYTHING about you and

         I agree with this 100%. Even though the drink has been around since the 1940's.

         Oddly enough, the reason the drink took off and became so popular in the 40's and 50's is
         because of the copper mug that the inventor used as a marketing gimmick. Now its come full
         circle - I see plenty of people getting Moscow Mules purely because of the "ooo shiny cup"

         Here's my trick and it works every time.  I don't  picture them naked. I just keep the idea
         in my mind that I'm not taking their time, they are taking mine.  Look at the audience like
         they are somehow beneath you and they owe you for giving this presentation.  It sounds
         arrogant but it works.  Throw a kind of scowl on and talk with a slightly prick attitude
         and you'll come off as confident rather than timid and afraid.  Act as if you own the room

         Exactly. Not sure how a 5'10 asian man with a bad back (me) could earn some decent money
         doing anything related to basketball...

         Same with "money doesn't buy you happiness."

         Yes it would.  Most of my main problems going on in my life is money related.  I would be
         very happy if all my bills are fully paid, the down payment of my car is paid, if I can pay
         to go after my dreams instead of being stuck where I am because I'm poor, I would eat more
         than ramen and hot dogs every other night, my SO and I would feel less stress that is
         keeping us up at night.

                     i was once told 'money doesn't buy you happiness' - i snapped back 'yeah but
                     it'll let me rent it.'

                     then two days later i heard the weird al song and was devastated that i hadn't

         I agree but I always want to shake people who take jobs that they don't want, for security
         reasons, way earlier than they probably have to. You have a wife and a kid? Yeah you better
         get a fucking stable job.

         My cousin gave up on his dream of being a basketball coach at 21 after years of working as
         a manager at a D-1 program because he got a stable union job. Look I get it, dreams may not
         come true but when you're young you owe it to yourself to try if it's even remotely
         possible to achieve. You have the rest of your life to be a responsible adult with a
         responsible adult job. Bet on yourself once in a while.

             Thanks, I needed to hear this.

             Granted, I'm 27, and I just can't shake the feeling that I'm supposed to have a
             decently-paying office job using the skills I've developed at this point. But the
             skills I've developed are for a career and industry that I absolutely loathe. I have a
             supportive family (parents) and I think I need to capitalize on my lack of wife-and-kid
             responsibilities and bet on myself.

         It won't always make you happy either. I did what I loved for years and for the most part,
         it just made me miserable because what i loved kept me working at extreme hours, paid me
         very little and put me in an unstable field in which I often suffered through long periods
         of unemployment.

         Do research on what you love. There might be some downsides that are really obvious that
         you need to know about.
