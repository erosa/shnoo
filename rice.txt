     Remember in The Notebook, Ryan Gosling threatens to kill himself if the girl doesn't agree to
     go out with him?

     I don't think that's a start to any kind of healthy relationship.

             Yeah, there's that one scene where he's like "you're a pain in my ass, but that's what
             we do." Excuse my shitty paraphrase. I don't know why people like this movie.

                 The reason that I like the movie has nothing to do with the Gosling/McAdams
                 storyline, and everything to do with James Garner. To be THAT in love with your
                 wife, to be THAT devoted, that even when she's forgotten EVERYTHING about you and
                 your life together--to go and spend time with her every day...that's incredible
                 love. I also work with people with dementia/Alzheimers, so I think it really hits
                 home for me.


                 Anyways, just thought you might like to hear an answer other than "Cuz he's HAWT".

                 I actually like that line because it's more realistic and sets the movie apart from
                 other flicks. Relationships are tough and people fight and they deal with it.
                 Relationships aren't some easy mode love story. You have to work at them. I think
                 its romantic but I am not usually into sappy chick flicks so maybe I am missing
                 something.

                     To add a little to this, Spidey sometimes adjusts the formula to last longer.
                     For example in one comic he webs a girl's window shut so she doesn't keep going
                     out at night, putting herself into danger, and he says he put webbing that
                     should last a couple of years on it.

                     Very dangerous in case of fire, but still.

             The one thing I thought Ant-Man did really well was subverting that trope.

             The movie acknowledges that Scott, the estranged father, needed to improve himself, and
             the hard-ass step-dad actually is a great presence in his daughter's life, and the
             reason he was giving Scott a hard time is cause he is genuinely protective of her.

             And instead of him 'winning' back his daughter in the end, Scott works with the step-
             dad and his ex wife to integrate himself into her current life without disrupting
             anything.

                     and his ex's new husband are at odds throughout the story, he's portrayed as a
                     good guy that's trying to do the right thing, and they eventually resolve their
                     differences. No need to make the new husband a horrible person or get the
                     original couple back together, he just wanted a place in his daughter's life,
                     and that's what he got.

                         If I remember correctly, the only thing keeping Scott out of his daughter's
                         life was himself. He got himself sent to jail, and after he got out, he
                         wasn't super-reliable. Despite that, his ex-wife and the new husband were
                         overall very patient with him and gave him lots of chances.

                         The story is pretty much about Scott's growth into the man he needs to be
                         for his daughter, which is great, and pretty realistic.

                     That's why I really liked Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

                     It's told through the guy's point of view so you kinda feel like Sarah's a
                     bitch and the guy who stole her from him is a dick at first.  But then the
                     Peter (the main char) hangs out with the gf stealer (Aldous) one day and at the
                     end of it he realizes he can't hate him because the guy was actually a fairly
                     nice guy.

                     Then through other conversations with Sarah, you realize that the relationship
                     ended NOT because of her but because of both of them and rather Sarah actually
                     tried to make it work multiple times but Peter kinda ignored those attempts.

                     So it was actually far more realistic than a great majority of the other rom-
                     coms (though of course being a rom-com you still have the typical tropes).

                         This is why you will continue to have white characters dominate.


                         Anything else is overanalyzed and picked apart.

                         >Rasputia, also played by Murphy, is cruel, selfish and abusive. She sucker
                         punches him in the face and cheats on him. Even on her wedding day, she's
                         so disgusting the congregation gusts in horror when her veil is lifted at
                         kiss the bride. Rasputia is so over-the-top offensive, so beyond crude,
                         that one has to wonder when Eddie Murphy wrote the script with his brother
                         Charles, what were these black men thinking. Don't they know about the myth
                         of black matriarchy? An infamous theory by Senator Patrick Moynahan is
                         suggested that black women's overbearing strength was the root cause of the
                         breakup of black families. It was met with waves of protests from African-
                         American scholars and activists that continue even today.

                         >Don't they know that the majority of black women will never marry in their
                         lifetime? And that Moynahan's implied reasoning remains unspoken all around
                         us, that she is so unfeminine and animalistic, this dark-skinned thing, so
                         emasculating to the male ego that no sane black man could possibly want
                         her? It's also as though the Murphy brothers were unaware of that more than
                         80 percent of black women are either overweight or obese and that this too
                         is the cause of suffering on an epidemic scale from type two diabetes to
                         high blood pressure to heart failure to heart failure and early strokes.


                         Or, maybe Rasputia is just an asshole.

                 [The Baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baxter) is a movie from the point of
                 view of the guy who the girl leaves (for her true love). The "he turns out to be an
                 asshole!" trope isn't used, but it's still a cool side to the story.

                 It's a very self-aware, fourth-wall-breaking movie - you're completely aware of the
                 Grand Hollywood Love Story unfolding between the two falling in love - but they
                 aren't the protagonists, and they aren't bad guys. They're almost... side
                 characters.  It focuses on the day-to-day of the guy losing his fiance.

                 Plus it's a Showalter/Wain movie (the guys who created the best movie of all time,
                 Wet Hot American Summer).

                         Yeah, everything they do is perfect. I made my friends watch WHAS over 10
                         years ago and they thought I was crazy. They hated it. When the prequel

         It reminds me a movie ending.  At the end of the movie the main character who's impulsive
         and adventuous interrupts a wedding and the bride leaves the dull fiancee and runs away.
         They get on a bus all laugthing and exited for the adventure they're going on.

         But the camera stays on them too long,   their laughter gradually stops and by the end
         they're sitting in silence,  the girl shows a  slight sign of regret on her face as she
         realizes what she just did.

             That has always bothered me. I can't stand any story where they had their great epic
             love and then quietly moved on to get married to someone else, but always loved the
             epic love more. There's an episode of Grey's Anatomy about an old couple finding each
             other after fifty years and both having lost their spouses and how they thought of each
             other every day they were married to other people. All I could think was how horrid

                         It's because Reddit likes the circle jerk that Titanic is an overrated
                         movie (which it is, but it's not *nearly* as overrated as Reddit makes it
                         out to be), so therefore everything about that movie is bad, which is not
                         true. While there are some characters who weren't written very well, Rose
                         is definitely not one of them. Honestly I think Rose as a character is very
                         well-rounded and intriguing. Her decisions make sense and it doesn't feel
                         like she's making decisions for the sake of moving the film's plot along

                         I actually think most of the female characters in Titanic were written
                         superbly and accurately reflected women's struggles at the time period the
                         film takes place. The male characters are a bit more hammy and caricature-
                         ish, *especially* Cal. That said, despite there being some problems with
                         the movie, I still think it's pretty darn great and I'll watch it anytime
                         it's on.

             complete a heist. Show them heading back to their base, breaking open the alcohol,

             that comes with slasher films.

             And then they find one of their group strung up, riddled with bullets.

             Play it like a slasher movie: they're desparately trying to escape their attacker,
             running into traps, trying to hold the slasher off.

             And finally, when the last villain in dying in the ground, bleeding out and begging for

                 I'd like to see a show called something like "aftermath" (all rights reserved) that
                 is on a network, that basically does story of the week, where they pick one other
                 show that's on that week and do like a "what the fuck happened next" shows like
                 like an order, or other case of the week shows that sometimes leave some pretty big
                 wreckage behind them would make an interesting show. It would also give them a
                 chance to discover some hidden talent. A lot of the side characters in those shows
                 are usually nobodies, but once in awhile a few them might get a chance to act for
                 an entire show rather than just a couple of minutes here and there. the studio
                 would have very little financial commitment since they'd be one and done, but they
                 might discover a few really good actors out of it.

                         I'm not sure Kylo can easily go light. The final test to become a true Sith
                         is to kill somebody close to you. It is designed to show finally severing
                         the ties that hold you back. Once across that line you can't easily go back
                         the other direction. It was always described in the fiction as having a
                         real physical impact on your relationship with the force.

                         It is also worth noting that Vader never actually crossed that line. The
                         one he always assumed he'd done was killing Padme but he didn't kill her
                         directly.

                         Of course Disney might well choose to piss all over our understanding of
                         how the dark side works.

         range. When Reacher has to fight his way into the bad guys trailer in a rock quarry, he
         calls Cash for help. As he lays out his plan, Cash basically says "You may do this all the

     Making a big scene in a public place to express your love for your girlfriend.  I suspect most
     women would hate that, and I would hate it if someone did that in an airport/restaurant/busy
     city sidewalk/wedding where I was minding my own business.

     Also, watch Top Gun again.  Maverick epitomizes someone you would hate if he existed in real

     the perfect answer to OP's question.

         and it shakes his whole foundation of selfworth, causing him to grow as a person and be a
         team player.

                 I'm sure. I want to read the book because the book is always better, but the movie
                 was a great piece of filmmaking. It's hard to read the book *after* the movie,

                     I read the book first and watched the film after. For me, the book was
                     fascinating because it's fun to observe Amy. She's so fucked in the head and
                     competent at the same time, which makes her really terrifying.

                     With the book, you get a better peek inside Amy's head. If you love Gone Girl
                     for its suspense then probably don't read it. But if you love it for Amy, then
                     you should read the book.

         Thing is - almost every 'cop' show has that sort of thing going on. You have all sorts of

         Don draper has plenty of moments where he is a very admirable human being. He stands up for
         what's right, and is an incredibly kind and compassionate man. He can be a good friend,
         father, husband and boss. But he isn't always. He can also be a sulking child having a
         temper tantrum. Or a horny, greedy jackass who doesn't think about how his actions could
         hurt those around him.

         The writers of that show try to trick us. We're supposed to spend time thinking that he is
         the ideal man. He is strong, confident, good at his job and better with the ladies. Mad Men
         is at its best however, when we see him fail to meet those standards that he has set for
         himself. He is a real, flawed individual, capable of incredible cruelty and stupidity. I
         think he is one of the best characters ever written. I don't think you can really pigeon
         hole him as either a bad man or a good man, because, like most of us, he is both.

         Probably because assholes are selfish people and feel that they have the right to do
         anything and it will be accepted due to attractiveness or wealth or power.  So things that
         make someone appear an ass are things that people with way too much confidence could
         theoretically do with little backlash.   People like to think of themselves as someone with
         power or good looks etc. Sure not everyone but lots like a protagonist that they can
         fantasise being.

             I think it's a lot easier to get away with in a movie because everything genuinely is
             about them. A lot of selfish behavior can seem justified when coming from a person who
             is the focus of the story, whereas in real life, we're all the protagonist of our own
             lives, so selfish behavior from other people contradicts our narrative.

                     And that's how it normally goes.  Close friends will give each other shit about
                     things -- usually not the things that they're truly sensitive about, though.

                     The ones you don't like?  You don't give them shit.

                     In that grey area of friends-but-not-quite-close-friends?  You give them shit,
                     then say "ah, I'm just giving you shit" to show you're you're actually treating
                     them like a friend.

         One of my pet peeves about movies and drinks is when the protagonist orders a drink in the
         manner you described.   Bartender hands them a drink, beer, or whatever.

         It sits on the bar or table and the hero barely even glances at it when something else
         happens.  Either someone walks in, or he gets a phone call, etc..   He then just walks away
         from the drink without taking even a sip.

         If I just bought a drink in a bar for $10 you can bet your ass that I'm going to drink it.
         If I get a call or something and am in a big hurry, I'd at least attempt to chug most of
         the drink.

         It depends on the bar. In my days of partying I've gotten to know quite a few bartenders
         and I always drink the same thing. With all of them it is at the point I can catch their
         eye from across the bar, I flash how many drinks I need, and they'll bring them and charge
         my tab without us exchanging a word besides me saying thanks. They also know any cash I
         throw down I do not want any change, any extra is a tip.

     Not ever talking.

     Watch the movie Drive. The driver says like 3 words the entire movie. Sometimes he waits like
     30 seconds to answer questions.

     In the context of the movie, it works. It's stylistic and there is a lot of information that is
     conveyed through visuals and pacing that makes him seem pretty bad ass.

     If I met him in real life, I would think he was an extreme sociopath or had some sort of mental
     deficiency.

                 But I wouldn't say that's the lesson Cameron learns. He learns more so that he
                 can't be a pushover anymore, and he has to stand up for himself. Otherwise people
                 like Ferris and his father will just walk all over him for his whole life.

                     Couldn't that also be part of Ferris' plan as well...to push Cameron to the
                     breaking point of self realization so that he can begin to assert himself? I
                     think there was a speech in the movie where Ferris is actually talking about
                     how submissive Cameron is and lays out Cameron's life if he doesn't change. I
                     think Ferris was completely aware of how much of a pushover Cameron was and
                     that he needed to force him to realize he could and should stick up for
                     himself.



                     To be honest, Cameron is, basically, the only one that learns something in the
                     movie, but, IMO, Ferris is the one that forces Cameron to learn (and,
                     therefore, the true hero). He knew what he was doing when he woke up that
                     morning.

                         I do not believe Ferris woke up that morning intent on destroying Cameron's
                         fathers car so Cameron would be forced to realize he needs to stand up for
                         himself. It's giving Ferris alot more credit than I think he deserves.

                         Ferris lays out his plan from the start. It's a beautiful day, and he
                         doesn't want to be stuck in school. Cameron gets roped into the plan
                         because he needs a car, and needs a nice car to get Sloan out of school.
                         Cameron is just part of Ferris' plan.

                         Now, I do agree Ferris fully knows Cameron is a pushover. That's why he
                         calls on him. He knows ultimately Cameron won't stop him. One of the only
                         moments Ferris' even feels anything resembling regret is after his antics
                         inadvertently lead to Cameron destroying the car, the only other real
                         moment of regret coming when Ferris realizes the garage guys took it
                         joyriding. Which is interesting to note. And then, Ferris offers to take
                         the fall. If Ferris takes the fall, Cameron learns nothing. Then again, by
                         taking the fall, Cameron, for better or worse, contributes to Ferris
                         staying the same. HAD Ferris taken the fall, his joyride, pun intended,
                         would have been over.

                         I just think it's giving Ferris much more credit than he deserves to imply
                         that the entire days plans were about forcing Cameron to stick up for
                         himself. Ferris didn't intend for the car to be destroyed, his whole plan
                         was to have a day of fun, and at the end of the day, have everything look
                         like they hadn't done anything.

         I feel the same way about RENT now that I'm older. I mean...that guy at the beginning
         (Benny) was trying to help his friends out (Roger and Mark) by giving them a job and
         building them a nice place to live FOR FREE if they work for him, they'd be doing what they
         love. Instead they're like "Screw you, we're not selling out! We're going to keep squatting
         in this crappy apartment! We're starving artists trying to make it in New York living the
         bohemian life!" Like...what? Grow up assholes, get a paying job, contribute to society, and
         stop complaining about having to pay your way in life. I dunno, but it really bugs me that
         this crap is romanticized like that. There is nothing wrong with getting a job to pay the
         bills and continuing to do the things you love as a hobby. Bonus, you can now afford to do
         those things because of your yuppie job.

             It's one of the few tropes that actually does hold up in real life, though.  People
             revere Woody Allen because he's talented.  But no one would dream of sticking up for a
             pedophile who just worked at the gas station.  If you're world class at something it
             really doesn't matter if you're an awful person.

             We all know Chris Brown beats women, but since he's good at what he does, he gets a
             pass.  No one would give a pass to a guy who washes dishes if he beat his wife.  "Now I
             know Gary put his wife in the hospital last week, but he cleans pots and pans like no
             other."

             I read an article in People magazine like ten years before we all turned on Bill Cosby
             about how he was raping women.  But he was still creating then, so he could still get
             away with it.  I think the main reason the tides finally turned on him is that he
             wasn't creating enough to get the special treatment anymore.  Although, the fact that
             he's black probably played a role.

             Tell me about it. Every time I go to the doctor, even for something like a cold, it's
             really scary. The least a doctor could do is not be a jerk. Especially if I'm going in

     Movie cops that go outside the law to do what's right. Okay, you're specifically supposed to

     Glassing a dude in a bar after you order a cranberry juice, and he asks you if you're on your

         I'm pretty sure the whole point of Leo glassing that dude was so that he would get noticed
         by Frank's people. I don't think he did it because he was an asshole, he did it so that he
         could find a way into Frank's crew. Under normal circumstances, I'm sure Leo's character
         would have given that guy a stern talking to instead of a glass to the dome but I could be
         wrong.

         Plus asking someone if they are on their period after they order a cranberry juice isn't
         exactly the nicest thing to do. It surely doesn't deserve a glass over the head, but it's
         not like that guy was a saint.

     There is an 80s movie that is a bit underrated for pointing out these things pretty
     fantastically--*The Adventures of Ford Fairlane*. It stars Andrew Dice Clay as a 'rock and roll
     detective' who basically is so stuck inside his vapid, cool guy act that he acts like an idiot
     while he tries to be cool for the entire movie.  It came out around the same time the backlash
     against him hit the peak but had a pretty decent budget so it holds up pretty well.

     Some things he emulates from the 'movie cool guy' handbook that are absolutely asshat material
     include: trying to have sex with practically every woman in the movie, naming his penis Stanley
     (*'ya know, like the power drill'*), obsessing over his car, obsessing over a guitar played by
     Jimi Hendrix to an insane degree, making up catch phrases and words, hitting a lot of people
     who don't really deserve it, practically sexually harassing his secretary, ogling sorority
     girls, he speaks his mind no matter who it offends (to his own detriment half the time),
     impedes and antagonizes the police, slides a guy across the bar knocking over dozens of drinks,
     shoots a disco ball to have it drop on a guy's head in a crowded club, driving through a
     cemetery and ogling a corpse (well, he believes it to be a corpse at the time), and while he's
     entirely broke he maintains a loft on the beach with a high end stereo system and the
     aforementioned car and guitar.

     It's a weirdly self aware action comedy that's really worth watching sometime, but yeah, always
     makes me think of how many cool guy tropes it hit.

         As I get older, this became much more apparent. I used to not be open with people that I
         play D&D, I doubt you'd know from looking at me so it was easy to hide it as it were.

         Yet as I got older and I tell people, it's become a litmus test of sorts. I've found that
         the coolest kind of people (or at least in my opinion) always say something like "Man I'd
         love to give that a try" or "I've never understood it, could you tell me more" as opposed

                 In this particular situation it would be hard to defend Jack, but you should always
                 be sketchy of these types of stories. Firstly because your getting one POV. Second
                 people tend to lie, exaggerate, or skip over things a little in their favor. Lastly
                 the use descriptor to push their message. If they want you feel bad they use things
                 like Sweet, and poor. If they want you to not feel bad, they will say they were an
