             That's actually pretty much how they think.

             I lived with someone from Turkey during an internship. She had a lot to say about the
             differences between American rights and their rights. Like she thought her country
             practiced "free speech" until coming here and realizing the term ment something totally
             different here.

                     I'm just stating the facts of that region. However, if your girlfriend's family
                     was involved with trying to overthrow the government than tick for tat.
                     Besides, the only reason I said that it was exciting is because of the
                     implications of what's currently happening. Especially when you consider the
                     fact that Turkey just kinda put itself on the map. In a really big way.

         s://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States#Congressional_suspension_of_ha
         beas_corpus) in cases involving "prisoners of war, spies, traitors, or military personnel."
         They actually tried to extend martial law to some civilian cases but the Supreme Court
         [ruled against that practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_parte_Milligan) in a famous
         court case.  Bush tried to get cute with the constitutional and human rights of prisoners
         after 9/11 too, but the courts pretty consistently shot him down.

         The difference is that Erdogan is essentially using this coup as a pretext to completely
         purge the courts, army, and government agencies of any political opposition.  He's
         literally destroying constitutional democracy in the name of national security, which goes
         well beyond anything ever done in the U.S. even during the worst national emergencies like
         the Civil War.  Pretty soon Turkey will have one-party rule and essentially dictatorship
         because Erdogan runs the AKP.  Not looking good.

         Many countries are wishy washy about human rights and pick and choose when and how to
         subscribe to them. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in and of itself is not
         legally binding. Its legally binding covenants are split into two. First is the
         International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which includes the right to vote,
         self determination, freedom of speech, the press, and expression, etc. The second is the
         International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights. This includes the right to
         housing, education, health care, etc. The reason they were split is because of the
         ideological divide of the Cold War.

         The US does not subscribe to the latter (because that would mean providing real adequate
         social welfare and that's a bunch of dirty commie business), and only does so to the former
         under the special case that all of those rights must be interpreted via our own
         constitution when applied to us. Whereas other nations like China might subscribe to the
         latter but no the former under the argument that political free will and expression mean
         nothing if you're starving and poor.

                 Fortunately, it's a false dilemma, because the government not providing human
                 rights and then acting on the vulnerability is essentially an act of denying it.

                 What a right exactly is will be up for debate, but a right can't be 'temporarily

                 That's the conversation happening largely about human rights and the differences
                 between positive and negative rights. From my own personal perspective, if we are
                 to accept the idea that human beings have innate dignity, and deserve to live
                 dignified lives, then we also have to accept that people have a right to housing,
                 education, etc. A government simply not denying those does not mean that they will
                 have access, and in those situations it is the responsibility of the government to
                 ensure that they do.

         As the late, great George Carlin said:
         "Now, if you think you do have rights, one last assignment for you. Next time you’re at the
         computer, get on the Internet, go to Wikipedia. When you get to Wikipedia, in the search
         field for Wikipedia, I want you to type in “Japanese Americans 1942,” and you’ll find out
         all about your precious fucking rights, okay? [applause] All right. You know about it. You
         know about it. Ya.

         In 1942, there were a 110,000 Japanese American citizens in good standing, law-abiding
         people, who were thrown into internment camps simply because their parents were born in the
         wrong country. That’s all they did wrong. They had no right to a lawyer, no right to a fair
         trial, no right to a jury of their peers, no right to due process of any kind. The only
         right they had, “right this way” – into the internment camps. Just when these American
         citizens needed their rights the most, their government took ’em away. And rights aren’t
         rights if someone can take ’em away. They’re privileges, that’s all we’ve ever had in this
         country, is a bill of temporary privileges. And if you read the news even badly, you know
         that every year the list gets shorter and shorter and shorter. [applause] You see what I
         was saying…

         Yeah… sooner or later the people in this country gonna realize the government does not give
         a fuck about them. The government doesn’t care about you, or your children, or your rights,
         or your welfare, or your safety, it simply doesn’t give a fuck about you. It’s interested
         in its own power, that’s the only thing, keeping it and expanding it wherever possible."

         Erdoğan once said that democracy for him is like a bus ride. “Once you arrive at your
         destination, you step off."

         And for Erdoğan, that 'destination' is a Caliphate - with Erdoğan as the Grand Poo-bah.

         However, I don't think the Arab world is ready for the return of the Ottoman Empire, to say
         nothing of the European world, but I doubt Erdoğan's ego will allow such trivialities to
         stand in the way and stop him from trying very hard to achieve it.

         I predict a truck bomb in Erdoğan's very near future.

                                         problem. It's the police force acting like the military
                                         without the training.

                                         schizophrenia was shot and killed, police officers have to
                                         go through a Trauma Informed Care Certification course
                                         yearly which teaches them about peaceful conflict

                             EXACTLY!!!!  I've been saying, for about a damn year now!  Ever since I
                             was watching those, I think it was Baltimore riots, that NOTHING is
                             going to change, NOTHING, until there is some reform in the police,
                             nationwide... there needs to be a complete over haul of how our police
                             are trained to handle situations, and not just pull their fucking gun
                             out whenever they feel like it.

                             Get rid of internal affairs, that's a fucking joke... and make police
                             responsible for their actions, by holding them to a higher standard
                             than the rest of us.

                             What they're doing, just ain't working... It's worse than during the
                             90s... and that's only because we have an easy way to document them
                             now.  They're caught off guard with everyone policing them with their
                             cameras.  There's a reason you see cops saying to people who pull their
                             cameras out "put them away, my camera works just fine"... It's because
                             it's put out to them in meetings, take away their ability to film for
                             evidence, guaranteed.

                             Cops are doing this to themselves though, by being too cocky to admit
                             that something is definitely wrong.

                             As a black person, you are 2.5 times as likely to be murdered by a

                         occasional idiot/unqualified individual.  Rather, it's that there's no

                             Whats so ironic and striking about this particular situation is how
                             civil, rational, and calm this victim was reacting to what was
                             happening to him, and his special needs client.

                             As someone who used to work with this population, I know how difficult
                             it can be to control challenging situations when your client is an
                             active part of them.  Change and stress, noise, new people, and any
                             active intense situation can bring some autistic folks to completely
                             freak out.  His therapist did everything in the right to try to keep
                             the situation calm and controlled, using very clear communication and
                             de-escalation tactics.

                             I am completely shocked and saddened by this video and the idiocy and
                             lack of training these cops displayed in this situation.

                             that everyone out there is looking to kill them, and every call or
                             traffic stop - no matter how routine - could be their last. It's gotten
                             to the point where, as we see here, an autistic person and his
                             caretaker are seen as a threat because of an unverified call from
                             someone about a suicidal person with a gun.

                             Even IF there was a suicidal person with a gun, I don't think turning
                             it in to a standoff is the way to go. Why not approach (carefully,

                             to protect the public from criminals.  The good cops aren't even
                             protecting the public from their own bad officers.  How can you be a

                             when you turn a blind eye to the same behaviors by fellow officers
                             perpetrating crimes aginst the very public they serve?  And it goes

                                     have his gun pointed at him with his finger on the trigger?

             In the 90s, I used to say that in order for people to actually do something about
             abusive police, they would have to catch a cop shooting a man in the back while running
             away.

             That happened to Walter Scott and still nothing happened.  I am going to up the ante.
             Now, in order for anyone to suspect there is a major problem, a cop will have to shoot
             a 2 year old toddler in the face.  In the back.  In broad daylight.

             I don't see how people cannot see what's going on.  I'm not white or black and it was
             plain as day in the 90s.  And I was late to the game in realizing it.

                         The officer was acqiuitted because so many cops shot the civilians that a
                         jury couldn't be sure which cop inflicted the fatal blow.

                                     So when police "fear for their life" they get a license to
                                     kill? What the actual fuck. So if some nut decided he feared
                                     for his life due to police and shot at police, would he get the
                                     same treatment? I understand this policy is in place to protect
                                     officers in the line of duty, but there should be strict rules
                                     in place to make sure that the officers also need to use common
                                     fucking sense before they even think about taking out their
                                     weapon. It should never just come down to "they feared for
                                     their life so theyre good". The police should also need to
                                     prive that what they did was reasonable and not a use of
                                     excessive force. With the cleveland case, were there any
                                     civilians taken hostage? Was the opposition shooting at the
                                     cops before the cops began to shoot? If the target was in a
                                     park by themselves, even after the chase, why weren't they
                                     given a chance to surrender when there was over 10 officers
                                     surrounding the car? How is this justice?

             >Maybe just talk softly but clearly the entire time as if I am not scared even though
             in reality I'd be freaking out... Like I would try to make my voice calming and
             reassuring with no sudden changes...

             "Hm, he's not scared. Clearly he's hiding a weapon. No other reason he'd be so
             confident and sound so defiant."

             Seriously though, as a minority there is nothing you can do but try to be calm and
             compliant and apologetic. It's pathetic, but you have to do it. Hearing anyone talk
             about how they were defiant with cops always blows my mind. But then again I have a lot
             of white friends.

             My best suggestion, as a fellow black person to anyone else out there who is brown or
             otherwise harassed by cops, is to ask the officer if there is anything you can do to
             make them more comfortable or to ask for the go ahead for every movement I make.

             Even then though, you run the risk of getting shot (less likely) or treated like a
             suspect (almost guaranteed every time). Even if you comply, you will still get the "Why
             are you asking me that?" "Well NOW you're making me uncomfortable"

             "Why are you so scared? What do you have to be scared about?"


             Best case scenario is you get taunted by the police officer and treated like a
             potential suspect.


             Oh man I've heard that last line plenty of times. I thought getting taunted by police
             officers was something everyone gets. Apparently that's not true. I have my doubts
             still though. I've never had any other kind of interaction.

         "Follow the officer's instructions and nothing will happen to you." The speech we always
         hear. And again, I am filled with anger because that doesn't seem to matter in some cases
         either. I'm angry because I have little faith that anything will happen with this. Nothing
         will change. I'm angry because I keep thinking to myself, how many more before there is
         some accountability. How many more times before the problem is addressed? Hell, how many
         more before the problem is even truly recognized?

         The only fragment of light I have is that Charles survived this situation. Someone who put
         his life on the line to save this young man's life because if they shot Charles, they
         certainly would have killed his patient for non-compliance and because of the whole "Fear
         for their life" get out of trouble card, there would certainly be no repercussion. In my
         eyes, he is a hero.

         Not all officers are bad. I understand that and have to remind myself every time something
         like this (where something is clearly wrong) happens. And honestly, I thank those who care
         about doing their job and serving the communities they protect. It's just once again, I am
         left wondering what exactly am I to do? In the end, even though I believe most cops are
         good, it only take one bad cop to end my life or the life of a loved one. And I fear that
         if it is the latter, I will no longer be able to remind myself.

             The quick and simple explanation: A former Russian anti-doping agent has alleged a
             massive, government-run conspiracy to dope Russian athletes and cheat in both the
             olympics and paralympics.

             As a result, WADA did a full investigation. During the course the investigation, the
             governing body for Track and Field decided, on the strength of evidence already
             collected, to ban all Russian athletes in Track and Field events. The Russian athletes
             affected appealed to an athletic court in Switzerland. This court just upheld that ban.

             The WADA report was finally released a few days ago, despite the lead investigator
             saying he needed more time to really get to the heart of the matter. He'd have
             preferred a longer investigation, saying he's only scratched the surface of the
             corruption discovered. Anyway, the WADA report upholds most of the allegations, adds a
             few new ones, and comes with corroborating evidence. As a result, WADA has asked the
             IOC to ban the *entire* Russian Olympic and Paralympic delegation. IOC is currently
             debating this.

                     I'm not suggesting people go out and drink saltwater, but calling it poisoned
                     is a bit of a stretch. (unless the chloride in question is something bizarre
                     like lithium chloride... but why would any government put that in water?)

                     Sidenote: apparently [cats don't mind drinking
                     saltwater](http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/content/196/3/633.short)...
