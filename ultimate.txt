     I'll get the ball rolling.

     * NY-DC: I like NY to cover this spread, their three meetings have all been one-point games. I
     also like NY to win with the upset, perhaps in overtime? Let's say NY (+1.5), NY 25 DC 24.
     * LA-SEA: Los Angeles has looked really great the past few weeks. They should definitely cover
     the spread imo, and playing at home with fan support? I like LA with the overtime upset. LA
     (+2.5), LA 27 SEA 25.
     * RAL-ATL: Atlanta has looked pretty solid at home, but on the road after a discouraging loss I
     think Raleigh runs away with this one. A shameless homer pick, RAL (-3.5), RAL 26 ATL 21.
     * MIN-PIT: Now this one is tricky. Both teams have had their ups and downs, so it will really
     come down to seeing if Pitt can put out a healthy line. I think they do and win, but Minnesota
     keeps it competitive. MIN (+4.5), MIN 24 PIT 26
     * SEA/LA-SF: I will be cheering for LA to get the upset and advance, but 8-ball says doubtful
     when the best team in the division gets to play with fresh legs. SF (-3.5), LA 23 SF 29

     Despite rooting for the Spinners, it was upsetting how the venue did not try to stay impartial
     during the game. De-fense! chants were being played over the loudspeakers only on Stags
     possessions, and the introduction for the Stags was half hearted compared to the Spinners
     intro. It's one thing for the crowd to heavily side with one team, but the venue should be
     neutral. You don't see things like this happen during the Superbowl. As much as I enjoy going
     to the championship games, I think it is time for one to be held on the west coast.

     A few notes from the game:

     Bjorkland and Perston did very little for Portland.  Perston was getting yards as a mid, but
     never really got any good deep opportunities (he was overthrown once or twice, got skied by
     Greg Martin once, and missed one on a bad read).  Bjorkland was not effective at all.  Outside
     of an early goal and a handblock, he had a bunch of turns, got D'd up a few times, and at one
     point got skied for an endzone D, then scored on at the other end, after which he got banded
     for re-spiking the philly spike right at the feet of the ref.

     Game was very physical downfield.  There were several calls by the refs, but there was a lot of
     contact from both sides away from the disc during cuts and repositioning.

     Philly went down 5-3 but ignited a comeback off a layout callahan (from a midfield pull).

     There was an hour+ lightning delay after the first half.  ~~By the time the second half
     started, it was past midnight Portland time.~~ I'm dumb.  Huge homefield advantage for the
     Spinners.

     Crowd was at least a few thousand... and at least half left after the lightning delay.

     It started raining sometime during the second half.  Portland fell apart during this quick
     downpour with a bunch of drops and throwaways due to the wet disc (Philly had some as well).
     Portland dropped at least one sure goal.  Philly jumped out to a 4 point lead around this time.

     The field is still way too big.  In the third and fourth quarters play slowed down
     significantly, a lot less hard cutting, a lot less effort to play tight D on wide cuts.  Tired
     players who can't expend energy to chase a guy all the way to the sideline on a 50 yard wide
     swing.

     Portland almost started something of a comeback with a callahan of their own, this one was
     really a gift from the Spinners on a lazy centering throw.  Holding the lead afterward, the
     Spinners ate huge chunks of the clock for the rest of the game.

     The disc part of the trophy broke off as the Spinners lifted it in celebration.

         This is a very good recap.

         Only quibble is that a lot of those 3rd&4th quarter points were very long... and after a
         loooooong break for half... the players were definitely gassed, but it wasn't solely due to
         field size. (I know you didn't say "solely" due to the field size, of course.)  It was also
         due to the weird timing of the game and the unusual length of the points.  A couple of
         drops and throwaways from each team can build into a whole other thing even in club
         ultimate on the smaller field.

         How was the score only 14-11? Was it due to the conditions, or physicality, or toughness of
         the two teams, or only 10 min/quarter, or some combination etc? I don't know, that seems

             Shorter quarters is one thing for sure, a typical MLU score is the winning team scores
             ~20 and the loser is in the teens.  In this game, both teams (at times) employed a very
             loose containment man defense, encouraging lots of swings, occasionally full zone.
             During the rain section of the game there were some long points.  Spinners
             intentionally ran down the clock during a few possessions, and managed to make Portland
             have a few long points with their defense.

         MLU covers itself better than the AUDL does by some margin (reliable streams, box scores,
         standings, etc) but it definitely suffers from a lack of external coverage.  For example,
         as of this posting (noon on 18 July), the [most recent piece of Ultiworld coverage for
         MLU](http://ultiworld.com/division/mlu/) is an [April 27th
         highlight](http://ultiworld.com/livewire/new-york-rumbles-sean-mott-makes-sportscenter-
         huge-sky/).
         The lack of coverage combined with fewer stakeholders around the country (only 8 cities of
         fans, and half of those teams are outclassed by an AUDL team in the same city) leads to
         less conversation.

             >MLU covers itself better than the AUDL does by some margin

             I think this depends on what you want to see in coverage. AUDL's video and commentary
             is far superior. They "show" things better, and have better production value in their
             main broadcasts and video packages. But MLU's stats, recaps, and reporting (the
             "telling" part of entertainment) is definitely in the lead by quite a margin.

                 Which MLU games are you watching?

                 My name is Dusty Rhodes and I do color commentary for many of the East Coast MLU
                 games.  I would love to learn how I can be better. Any suggestions?

                     Attempted watching West games, but broadcast quality (feed + commentators) were
                     abominable. Boston + Philly feeds are good (and reliable), but something about
                     the disc movement from the presentation style (possibly could be disc) in the
                     MLU feels stale.

                     >My name is Dusty Rhodes and I do color commentary

                     I'm familiar. To the point: You talk *way* too much. I understand that it's
                     probably in an attempt to present yourself as informed (you are), but after
                     about five minutes of listening, it becomes white noise and can sometimes
                     detract from the on-field action.

                     Especially after big highlight plays. I don't really care to hear an immediate
                     breakdown of the entire, previous point. Just allow the play to resonate with
                     the audience for a moment. When you crowd into each play with immediate,
                     granular analysis, it feels as if you don't trust the audience to understand
                     the action on their own. It comes across as paternalistic, in a "No, here's
                     what you're not understanding..." kind of way.

                         Word!  Thanks for the response!

                         I struggle internally a ton with how much to talk and how much to not-talk.
                         Not just as a broadcaster, but as a human (I tend to be wholly silent or
                         waaaay too talkative).  I love lectures, for example, and sitting and
                         listening to monologues on topics I am interested in.  This is one of the
                         reasons I enjoyed college so much.

                         Which is to say that it isn't that I don't trust the audience (I recognize
                         that you typed "feels as if") it is more that I want to be sure they have a
                         chance to see the things that I find so fascinating about ultimate.  The
                         granular descriptions and break-downs are what I love from commentators in
                         other sports, and in general wish I could hear more details and specifics
                         of what occurred to lead to the big (and/or small) plays. For example, in
                         basketball I want to know exactly why each player is where (based on
                         offensive and defensive sets/calls and individual proclivities) more than I
                         want to marvel at individual skill.  Individual skill speaks for itself
                         while team-level structures/patterns are often voiceless and lost to
                         viewers.

                         Finding the balance, of course, is the key and without feedback, I'll never
                         learn how to balance.

                         I really appreciate the criticism.  Now that the MLU off-season is upon us,
                         I can get self-critical and work on my game!  I've been doing this for two
                         years now and want to be so much better at it than I am now.

                 I'd agree that the featured AUDL video content tends to be better than MLU's
                 average content, but would quickly contest the idea that their holistic video
                 offerings are better--at least on the east coast the MLU content is reliable, looks
                 good, and the commentary has, at the least, an acceptably high floor.

                 This is in contrast with the swath of AUDL games with no streaming video coverage,
                 as well as the non-featured local streams that can be downright atrocious in video
                 and audio.
