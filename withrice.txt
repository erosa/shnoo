         Blue Moon beer - 9/10

         Blue Moon over rice - 6/10

         Taste isn't even that bad, but I made a serious miscalculation over the fact that the rice
         would warm up the beer.

             So the cheese isnt white?

             Edit: I know white is a race, I said this assuming the cheese is white, because you
             know, on occassion it is.

         Doesn't make too much of a difference, the peanut butter heavily masks the rice and just
         changes a bit of texture.
